# Leetcode Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **Leetcode Solutions** repository! This repository is a collection of solutions to various Leetcode problems, organized by difficulty level. The repository aims to provide clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions to help other developers understand and improve their coding skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into branches based on the difficulty levels of Leetcode problems:

- **`easy`**: Contains solutions to "Easy" level problems.
- **`medium`**: Contains solutions to "Medium" level problems.
- **`hard`**: Contains solutions to "Hard" level problems.

Each branch contains Python solution files that follow the naming format:

```
<ProblemNumber>_<ProblemName>.py
```

### Example

- `1_Two_Sum.py`
- `2_Add_Two_Numbers.py`
- `3_Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters.py`

This format makes it easy to locate a specific problem by number and name.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the main branch.
2. **Checkout Specific Difficulty Branch**: Switch to the desired branch (easy, medium, or hard) to see the solutions of that difficulty level.
   ```bash
   git checkout easy
   ```
3. **Browse Solution Files**: Each solution file is self-contained and follows Python best practices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add new solutions, improve existing ones, or fix bugs:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name.
4. Add your solution using the format `<ProblemNumber>_<ProblemName>.py`.
5. Push your changes and create a pull request.

### Guidelines for Contribution

- **Naming Convention**: Follow the `<ProblemNumber>_<ProblemName>.py` naming format.
